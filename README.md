Faculty Grading Practices and Student Perceptions of Fairness

This repository contains the research project An Analysis of Faculty Grading Practices and Student Perceptions of Fairness at X University. The study explores how faculty design grading criteria, ensure transparency, mitigate biases, and provide feedback, alongside student perceptions of grading fairness.

Project Overview





Objective: Analyze faculty grading practices and their impact on student perceptions of fairness using a mixed-methods approach.



Methodology:





Faculty Interviews: Semi-structured interviews with six faculty members, covering eight questions on grading criteria, communication, challenges, feedback, participation, bias mitigation, grade disputes, and motivation.



Student Surveys: Likert-scale surveys (not included in this repository) to assess student perceptions.



Data: Anonymized faculty interview responses, cleaned and structured for analysis.



Tools: Python (Pandas) for data processing and thematic/quantitative analysis.

Repository Structure





data/: Contains anonymized faculty response data in CSV format.



scripts/: Python scripts for data analysis, including question-wise, faculty-wise, and thematic analyses.



docs/: Project documentation, including methodology and analysis summaries.



README.md: This file.

Key Findings





Faculty align grading with course objectives but face challenges like large class sizes and subjectivity.



Transparent communication (e.g., course outlines, early discussions) is standard.



Rubrics and blind marking reduce biases, though some faculty rely on intent over structure.



Clear, positive feedback boosts student motivation; negative feedback risks demotivation.



Participation is often graded, requiring clear rubrics to ensure fairness.

Usage





Clone the repository:
