## Faculty Grading Practices and Student Perceptions of Fairness

This repository hosts the research project An Analysis of Faculty Grading Practices and Student Perceptions of Fairness at X University. The study explores faculty grading criteria, transparency, bias mitigation, and feedbackâ€™s impact on student motivation and fairness perceptions.

Project Overview





Objective: Analyze faculty grading practices and their impact on student perceptions using a mixed-methods approach.



Methodology:





Faculty Interviews: Self-collected semi-structured interviews (written and verbal) with six faculty members, covering eight questions on grading criteria, communication, challenges, feedback, participation, bias mitigation, grade disputes, and motivation.



Student Surveys: Self-collected Likert-scale surveys via Google Forms (not included) to assess student perceptions.



Data: Anonymized faculty interview responses, cleaned for analysis.



Tools: Python (Pandas) for thematic and quantitative analysis.

Repository Structure





data/: Anonymized faculty response data in CSV format.



scripts/: Python scripts for question-wise, faculty-wise, and thematic analyses.



docs/: Project documentation, including methodology and Research_Slide_apw.pdf (presentation slides).



README.md: This file.

Key Findings





Faculty align grading with course objectives but face challenges like large class sizes and subjectivity.



Transparent communication (e.g., course outlines, early discussions) is standard.



Rubrics and blind marking reduce biases; some faculty rely on intent over structure.



Clear, positive feedback boosts motivation; negative feedback risks demotivation.



Participation is graded, requiring rubrics for fairness.

Project Achievements





Developed a mixed-methods framework, integrating qualitative and quantitative data.



Self-collected and analyzed 48 faculty responses, identifying eight themes (e.g., transparency, feedback impact).



Created reusable Python scripts for educational research.



Ensured ethical data handling by anonymizing sensitive information.
